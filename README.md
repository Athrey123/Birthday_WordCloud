## Installation

Clone this repository with 
```
git clone https://github.com/ishita-kumar/Birthday_WordCloud.git
```

## Usage
1. Export your group chat/ personal chat with your loves ones. Since I'm more of a WhatsApp person, my code is used for a whatsapp personal message. Save this by Tap More options > More > Export chat.
2. Rename the chat to WhatsApp.txt and replace in on your cloned folder.
3. We use standard python libraries like numpy, pandas etc. You might need to carry out a pip install. This is a python V2.7 Code.
4. I added a ton of Stop words, but you can filter out even more words as per your need.
5. The background I used was of my University, you can change it too but make sure you use a high resolution background image with contrast. YOu can also change the color of the text and or background!
6. Run the code using python word.py and enjoy!
